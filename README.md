# NFL_QB_Predictions
This is a little project I did to see if I could try and predict how the future Qbs of the NFL will turn out. 
I took a little over 100 college QBs from the years 2004-2012 that were drafted into the nfl I omited only the ones that I could find no data on. Curently the first model I ran of this is 72% acurate and I feel like that is good but I would like to get it higher.<br> <br>

Ways to get better acuracy: <br>
1) get more data<br>
2) try different models<br> <Br>
                            
                           
The data files are in the QBs folder and consist of:<br>
              1)  <b>2004-2011 college stats</b>: this is there carrer college stats that I used for the model<br>
              2)  <b>2004-2011 drafts</b>: all the QBs drafted in that time frame and shows a little bit of how they did in the nfl up to <br> 2020<br>
              3)  <b>players to test</b>: the players that I tested mostly being the 2020 first round selections
